Pathfinder Buff Tracker
=======================
This is a web app built around the bufftracker project.

That's it.  Feel free to steal stuff from it, use it, whatever.

Mostly for my own use. If you like the idea, checkout the project at
http://github.com/darelf/bufftracker where the library that does the
actual work is located.
